METHODS
  new ( \%args )
    The following arguments are accepted:

    block
        An arrayref of hostnames to block, without a 'www.' prefix (if
        present) as these will be blocked automatically.

        guess based on current operating system.

    network_command
        A reference to an array passable to "system()" that will restart the
        network, e.g.

         ['/etc/init.d/network', 'restart']

  work
    Set work mode - block the sites specified.

  play
    Set play mode - unblock sites.

  blocklist
    Return the blocklist, with 'www.' and non-'www.' versions included.

  network_command
    Return user-specified network command as arrayref, or undef if none
    specified.

  hosts_file
